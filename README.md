## Updates
#### Dev Update â€” July 6th, 2023 ðŸ¥°
After relocating to Frankfurt, DE, Iâ€™m gearing up to resume development of this portfolio. Excited to explore Webflow's new React component export tool for easier design collaboration!

#### Dev Update â€” Feb 13th, 2023
Set up Jest, but focusing on refining other components. Life's busy, but I'm still pushing ahead!
